# MedLEDGER
MedLEDGER is a blockchain-based health record system designed to revolutionize the way patient data is stored and shared. 


### Problem Statement
MedLEDGER tackles fragmented health records, interoperability issues, security vulnerabilities, and limited patient control in healthcare. Using blockchain technology with Solidity, Ganache, Truffle, Node.js, and React.js, it creates a secure, decentralized platform for authorized access to patient data, ensuring data integrity and privacy. MedLEDGER aims to improve data sharing among providers, empower patient control, and enhance care quality.

### Our Objective
Using Hyperledger Fabric for blockchain provides secure, immutable storage for patient records. Decentralized access control ensures only authorized parties can access data, enhancing privacy. Efficient data management reduces administrative burdens and costs. Patients also gain control over their health data, managing access in real-time.
